# A folder that contains my angular practice of different angular features 
I'm also using this folder as my angular syntax memo
If someone wants to try, they should start by creating an Angular project. Then, select one of the folders from this repository, rename it to 'app,' and replace the 'app' folder in their newly created project with the chosen one.
(I'm using angular 16 btw)
